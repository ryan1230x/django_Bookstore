# django_Bookstore
# About This project

This project was created using django python framework with Bootstrap for the CSS styling, I wanted this to be a simple yet
elegant design, using very little colours sticking with white and grey.

# What I have learned

This is the first project that I have created using Django framework, the framework helped me learn more about the
MVC(Model, View , Controller) however it is said that Django is considered to me of a MVT(Model, View, Template) work pattern.

The project has also helped me gain experience using Python, this is my first time using Python in any project it has helped
me understand how powerful and usefull the language is for making full stack web applications.
